# LivingMatrixWork
This is a repository of all the work I did during my time at LivingMatrix, Inc. from July to August, 2019

The majority of these files are data files and pieces of work from the bulk of my internship. I used Jupyter Notebook to create and manipulate the ipynb files.  
Feel free to have a look around them. In addition, I have provided access to some larger data files that I used and a copy of my final presentation as zip files  
on Google Drive. Here is the link to the public folder from which you can access this: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RhFcJh58vCxv0lXDumkhiTnaGpQHP9gD?usp=sharing
